*"From Compartments to Individuals: A Complementary Analysis of ODE and Agent-Based Models for Simulating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Control Strategies in Hospitals."*

The code provides a modular framework for simulating hospital transmission dynamics of MRSA using an agent-based model (ABM). It complements the compartmental ODE models discussed in the thesis.
